<h1 style="text-align: center;">HTML Canvas</h1>

<b>The `<canvas>` element in HTML is a powerful feature for rendering graphics and shapes directly within web pages. Though it's often paired with JavaScript for dynamic rendering, the canvas itself is an HTML element.</b>

## What is Canvas?

The `<canvas>` element serves as a container for graphics, which can be rendered via scripting. Essentially, it offers a drawing area for visual content.

## Why Use Canvas?

Here are some reasons why you might use the `<canvas>` element:

- **Graphics:** For drawing shapes, graphs, and other visual representations.

- **Dynamic Content:** To dynamically update visual elements.
- **Interactivity:** Though this involves JavaScript, the canvas element is the foundation for interactive graphical content.

## Basic Syntax

Here's how you can define a simple `<canvas>` element:

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
```

## Attributes of Canvas

While the `<canvas>` element is simple, it does have a couple of important attributes:

- **width:** Specifies the width of the canvas.

- **height:** Specifies the height of the canvas.

## Styling with CSS

You can also style the `<canvas>` element with CSS. For example, to add a border:

```css
canvas {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

## Conclusion

The HTML `<canvas>` element serves as a robust foundation for creating graphics and other visual elements on a web page. Even without involving JavaScript, understanding the canvas element and its basic attributes can be quite useful.

<b>Our day-to-day lives often involve the use of lists. For example, when we go shopping, the bill we receive includes a list of all the items we've purchased. In a similar manner, web developers use lists to neatly display data on websites.</b>

## Types of HTML Lists

HTML provides different types of lists to display data in various forms. Each list contains one or more list items.

- **Unordered List:** Displays items using bullets.
- **Ordered List:** Displays items in a numerical sequence, and supports various numbering styles like Arabic numerals, Roman numerals, and so on.
- **Definition List:** Organizes items in a format similar to a dictionary, with terms and their corresponding definitions.

## An Unordered List

An unordered list uses bullets to display items. It is suitable for listing items where the order doesn't matter. We will soon explore unordered lists in great detail

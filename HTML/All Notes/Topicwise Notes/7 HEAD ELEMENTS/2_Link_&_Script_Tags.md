<b>The `<link>` and `<script>` tags are essential elements within an HTML document's <head> section. They serve various purposes, like linking external stylesheets or including JavaScript files.</b>

## The `<link>` Tag

The `<link>` tag is commonly used to link external stylesheets to an HTML document. It's a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't require a closing tag.

Below is an example HTML code snippet that includes a `<link>` tag to link an external stylesheet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
```

## The `<script>` Tag

The `<script>` tag is used to include JavaScript code or files in an HTML document. Unlike the `<link>` tag, the `<script>` tag must be closed with a `</script>` tag.

Below is an example HTML code snippet that includes a `<script>` tag to link an external JavaScript file:

```html
<script src="script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

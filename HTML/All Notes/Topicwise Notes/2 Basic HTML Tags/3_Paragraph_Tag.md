<h1 style="text-align: center;">Paragraph Tag</h1>

<b>To create well-structured text in your HTML document, the `<p>` tag is essential for defining paragraphs.</b>

## `<p>` Tag: Defining a Paragraph in HTML

- The `<p>` tag is used to format text into distinct paragraphs. Each paragraph element is separated by automatic empty line spaces above and below the content, providing a clear visual separation. The tag must be closed with its corresponding `</p>` tag.

  ```html
  <p>
    <!-- Paragraph content -->
  </p>
  ```

## Attributes and Styling

- While the `<p>` tag is straightforward, you can enhance its functionality using various attributes like class or id for CSS styling. You can also include inline styles using the style attribute.

  ```html
  <p class="example" style="color: blue;">This is a styled paragraph.</p>
  ```

## Best Practices

- It's advisable to use the `<p>` tag for textual content and not for layout control. For layout purposes, consider using HTML5 semantic tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, or CSS techniques.

<b>Images play a crucial role in enhancing web pages by providing a visual context that complements textual content. In HTML, the `<img>` tag is used to embed images into web pages.</b>

## Basic Syntax for Embedding Images

- This is how the syntax to embed an image in html looks like:

  ```html
  <img src="image's path" />
  ```

## Key Features of the `<img>` Tag

- It's a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't require a corresponding closing tag.

- Commonly used attributes include the "alt" attribute for image descriptions and the "src" attribute for specifying the image location.

- Supports various image formats including PNG, JPEG, JPG, and GIF.

## Setting Mandatory Attributes

- The "src" and "alt" attributes are essential for the proper functioning of the `<img>` tag.

  - **src attribute:** Specifies the path to the image file.
  - **alt attribute:** Provides a text description for the image.

    ```html
    <img src="images/profile_picture.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" />
    ```

- **Note:** To find the image's location, right-click on the image, go to properties, and check the location field.

## Setting Image Dimensions

- Although dimensions can be set using the "width" and "height" attributes in the `<img>` tag, modern best practices recommend using CSS for this purpose.

  ```html
  <img src="image.png" alt="Description" width="300" height="100" />
  ```

- Setting the width and height attributes for images in HTML can have a positive impact on [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo).
- Specifying these dimensions in the `<img>` tag allows browsers to allocate the correct amount of space on a web page even before the image is fully loaded.
- This prevents layout shifts, improving the [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/articles/cls) scoreâ€”a key metric in Google's Core Web Vitals. A better CLS score can lead to a higher page ranking in search engine results.

- **Note:** Styling dimensions and other properties are now more commonly managed through CSS for better flexibility and maintainability.

## Conclusion

The `<img>` tag is an essential element in HTML for embedding images, enhancing the visual appeal and context of web pages. By using key attributes like "src" and "alt", developers can ensure that images are properly displayed and accessible. While the tag allows for setting dimensions directly, modern best practices favor using CSS for more flexibility. Properly managing image dimensions not only improves user experience by preventing layout shifts but also positively impacts SEO, making it crucial for web developers to understand and implement these practices effectively.

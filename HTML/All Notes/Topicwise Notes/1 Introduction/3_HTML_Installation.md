## What are the prerequisites to learning HTML?

- There are **no prerequisites to learning HTML**.
- HTML is the foundational language of the web and is often the first step for aspiring web developers.

### Tools Needed to Make an HTML Page

1. **HTML Editor:**

   - A straightforward tool where all HTML content is written.
   - You can use any text editor of your choice. I recommend **Visual Studio Code** for its lightweight and open-source nature.
   - Other popular editors include:
     - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
     - [TextEdit](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/textedit/welcome/mac)
     - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
     - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
     - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
   - Online platforms like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) are also great for quick HTML editing and testing.
   - **Note:** You can write HTML even in Notepad, but editors like VS Code make the process easier.

2. **Browser:**
   - Browsers interpret HTML tags to render web pages visually.
   - I use **Chrome** for testing and viewing HTML pages.

## Installation & Setup of Visual Studio Code for HTML

- To optimize HTML development, we will install Visual Studio Code and set it up:
  - Search for **Visual Studio Code download** on Google.
  - Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating system (I am using Windows).

## Live Server Extension

- We will also install the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code to view live reload pages.
- The Live Server extension launches a local development server with a live reload feature, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you edit your HTML files.

## Conclusion

HTML is a crucial skill for web development. With the right tools and resources, you can start creating your own web pages today!
